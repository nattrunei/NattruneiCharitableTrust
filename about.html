                        <p class="mb-4">Nattrunei Charitable Trust is a beacon of hope and compassion, established with the core mission of uplifting the lives of the underprivileged and bringing meaningful change to society. Rooted in the values of service, empathy, and equality, our trust is committed to providing educational support, medical assistance, and essential aid to those in dire need.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mb-3">Our primary focus lies in:</h4>
                        <ul class="mb-4">
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Educational Assistance:</strong> Supporting children and youth from economically challenged backgrounds by providing school supplies, scholarships, tuition fees, and mentorship, helping them build a brighter future through learning.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Medical Help:</strong> Assisting poor families and individuals with access to medical treatment, medicines, health camps, and emergency support, ensuring no one is denied the right to health due to financial constraints.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Social Welfare:</strong> Responding to the day-to-day needs of the very poor—offering food, clothing, and basic necessities—especially during times of crisis and calamity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="mb-4">As a part of our humanitarian efforts, we also run a dedicated blood donation group, connecting voluntary donors with patients in urgent need. This life-saving initiative has already made a significant difference in critical situations, saving lives through timely support.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">At Nattrunei Charitable Trust, we believe that small acts of kindness can create ripples of change. With the support of generous donors, passionate volunteers, and community members, we continue to strive toward a more inclusive, caring, and empowered society.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">Join us in our journey of service. Together, we can transform lives—one act of compassion at a time.</p>
